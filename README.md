# Masters-Research
My Masters Research Project is based on the concepts of Deep learning, Machine Vision, Image Processing, ROS2, Gazebo ignition, Machine Learning and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). This repository holds my Masters thesis and trimmed recorded videos of six different simulation experiments I performed during my Masters research. These experiments 1 to 3 are based on simple gazebo ignition environment in which SLAM and Autonomous Navigation are performed with LiDAR, Depth Camera, and Infrared Camera respectively. The experiments 4 to 6 are done in similar fashion except the NeRF based models are incorporated into simulation Environment for comparison and Analysis. Here only Experiment 1 and 6 videos are uploaded as reference.
